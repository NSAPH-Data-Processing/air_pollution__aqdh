Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 microgram per cubic meter (PM2.5) increases mortality and morbidity. PM2.5 is composed of a mixture of chemical components that vary across space and time. Due to limited hyperlocal data availability, less is known about health risks of PM2.5 components, their U.S.-wide exposure disparities, or which species are driving the biggest intra-urban changes in PM2.5 mass. The national super-learned models were developed across the U.S. for hyperlocal estimation of annual mean elemental carbon, ammonium, nitrate, organic carbon, and sulfate concentrations across 3,535 urban areas at a 50m spatial resolution, and at a 1km resolution for non-urban areas from 2000 to 2019. Using Machine-Learning models (ML), combined with either a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) Ensemble Geographically-Weighted-Averaging (GAM-ENWA) or Super-Learning (SL) and approximately 82 billion predictions across 20 years, hyperlocal super-learned PM2.5 components are now available for further research. The overall R-squared values of 10-fold cross validated models ranged from 0.910 to 0.970 on the training sets for these components, while on the test sets the R-squared values ranged from 0.860 to 0.960. Remarkable spatiotemporal intra-urban and inter-urban variabilities were found in PM2.5 components. The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for predictions is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) and the Units for the PM2.5 Components are microgram per cubic meter.

Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 microgram per cubic meter (PM2.5) is a human silent killer of millions worldwide, and contains many trace elements (TEs). Understanding the relative toxicity is largely limited by the lack of data. In this work, ensembles of machine learning models were used to generate approximately 163 billion predictions estimating annual mean PM2.5 TEs, namely Bromine (Br), Calcium (Ca), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Potassium (K), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), Silicon (Si), Vanadium (V), and Zinc (Zn). The monitored data from approximately 600 locations were integrated with more than 160 predictors, such as time and location, satellite observations, composite predictors, meteorological covariates, and many novel land use variables using several machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods. Multiple machine-learning models were developed covering urban areas and non-urban areas. Their predictions were then ensembled using either a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) Ensemble Geographically-Weighted-Averaging (GAM-ENWA), or Super-Learners. The overall best model R-squared values for the test sets ranged from 0.79 for Copper to 0.88 for Zinc in non-urban areas.

Ensemble predictions of three machine-learning models were implemented (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network) to estimate the daily PM2.5, O3, and NO2 at the centroids of 1km x 1km grid cells across the contiguous U.S. for 2000 to 2016. The predictors included air monitoring data, satellite aerosol optical depth, meteorological conditions, chemical transport model simulations, and land-use variables. The ensemble models demonstrated excellent predictive performance with 10-fold cross-validated R-squared values of 0.86 for PM2.5, 0.86 for O3, and 0.79 for NO2. These high-resolution, well-validated predictions allow for estimates of ZIP Code-level pollution concentrations with a high degree of accuracy. For general ZIP Codes with polygon representations, pollution levels were estimated by averaging the predictions of grid cells whose centroids lie inside the polygon of that ZIP Code; for other ZIP Codes such as Post Offices or large volume single customers, they were treated as a single point and predicted their pollution levels by assigning the predictions using the nearest grid cell. The polygon shapes and points with latitudes and longitudes for ZIP Codes were obtained from Esri and the U.S. ZIP Code Database and were updated annually. The data include about 31,000 general ZIP Codes with polygon representations, and about 10,000 ZIP Codes as single points. The aggregated ZIP Code-level, daily predictions are applicable in research such as epidemiology, public health, and political science, by linking with ZIP Code-level demographic and medical data sets, including national inpatient care records, medical claims data, census data, and U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS). The data are particularly useful for studies on rural populations who may lack air monitoring sites. Compared with the 1km grid data, the ZIP Code-level predictions are much smaller in size and are manageable in personal computing environments. This greatly improves the inclusion of scientists in different fields by making it easier to use these data in air pollution research. The Units are ug/m^3 for PM2.5 and ppb for O3 and NO2.","time_end":"2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","service_features":{"opendap":{"has_formats":false,"has_variables":false,"has_transforms":false,"has_combine":false,"has_spatial_subsetting":false,"has_temporal_subsetting":false},"esi":{"has_formats":false,"has_variables":false,"has_transforms":false,"has_combine":false,"has_spatial_subsetting":false,"has_temporal_subsetting":false},"harmony":{"has_formats":false,"has_variables":false,"has_transforms":false,"has_combine":false,"has_spatial_subsetting":false,"has_temporal_subsetting":false}},"orbit_parameters":{},"id":"C2563727886-SEDAC","has_formats":false,"score":0.97999995,"consortiums":["EOSDIS","GEOSS"],"original_format":"UMM_JSON","collection_data_type":"SCIENCE_QUALITY","archive_center":"SEDAC","has_temporal_subsetting":false,"browse_flag":true,"platforms":["MODELS"],"online_access_flag":true,"links":[{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/browse#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/aqdh/aqdh-pm2-5-o3-no2-concentrations-zipcode-contiguous-us-2000-2016/sedac-logo.jpg"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/data#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C2563727886-SEDAC"},{"rel":"http://esipfed.org/ns/fedsearch/1.1/documentation#","hreflang":"en-US","href":"https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/docs-repo/aqdh-pm2-5-o3-no2-concentrations-zipcode-contiguous-us-2000-2016-readme.txt"}]}]}}
